romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect .
has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital .
an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism .
[allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .
an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
mildly amusing .
not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .

i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back .
it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting .
it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .
all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 .
passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road .
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
