it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .
the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .

the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much .

exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair .

rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .

a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken .
a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis .
where the film falters is in its tone .
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .

a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .
a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .

the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me .
a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 .
has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " .
